# Loadstringer

## What is Loadstringer ?
Loadstringer is a extension that works with most browsers. What this extension does is it converts whichever url you are on into a loadstring so for e.g if im on https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Angxers2/Unihub/main/Unihub%20V1.2.lua it it will convert it into a loadstring url it is really handy and quick to deal with loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Angxers2/Unihub/main/Unihub%20V1.2.lua",true))()
